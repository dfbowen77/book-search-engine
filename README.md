## Description
The following application is designed to meet the requirements of the module 21 challenge. It represents the beginnings of a book search engine using the MERN stack framework, meaning the web application was made via MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The book search engine has the following functionality. When users first visit the application they are presented with the opportunity to either search for a book or to login/sign-up. If they search for a book prior to logging in then they only have access to the search results. However, if they login they are able to save specific books to a list of saved books. Also when logged in they have the ability to view a list of all their saved books as well as to delete books from their list.
